Traffic state data from the I-5expressway in Seattle, Washington.

These data come from DRIVE Net (Digital Roadway Interactive Visualization and Evaluation Network), an on-line transportation platform aimed at data sharing, integration, visualization, and analysis. It is funded by WSDOT (Washington State Department of Transportation) and maintained by STAR Lab (Smart Transportation Applications and Research Laboratory). All data can be freely used for academic research. For more information about the DRIVE Net and STAR Lab, please contact Dr. Yinhai Wang : yinhai@uw.edu.

The file name indicates the data type (speed), route (005), direction (inc), detector (16272) and collection time (2015). For example, speed-005inc16885-2015.csv, etc.

Each file contains only two columns: "Stamp" and "Speed". You can open it with any text editor.

Good luck :-)
